                <div class="ProductTypeTittle"><p>Neocutis means 'new skin', and that's precisely what the products in their collection can create: a new, youthful complexion that is visibly smoother and firmer to the touch. PSP and the other ingredients found in the collection have been rigorously tested for safety and effectiveness, and their incredible benefits for the skin are undeniable. See for yourself how the breakthrough PSP complex in Neocutis products can dramatically improve your complexion.<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">  Neocutis products are formulated to be free of artificial fragrances and free of color additives.

                    For many men and women, signs of aging are not just indications that the skin is transitioning through the changes that accompany aging. Many people age before their time due to the destructive effects of free radicals found in ultraviolet energy and impurities in the environment. In this way, signs of aging are often signs of damage, signaling that the cells that make up the tissue have been weakened and are no longer producing the materials needed to maintain skin strength and elasticity at a fast enough rate to maintain the appearance of the complexion.
                    
                    Neocutis skincare products address signs of damage, not just by acting on the surface skin to reduce their appearance. The PSP complex developed by the Swiss researchers at the brand actually works on the underlying source of the damage. The Processed Skin Proteins help to encourage cellular rejuvenation, revitalizing damaged cells, so that they can once more begin to function optimally. Over time, this leads to gains in skin elasticity and strength, which make existing lines less noticeable and the complexion more resistant in the future.
                    
                    PSP isn't the only breakthrough ingredient complex created by the scientists at Neocutis. The brand has also engineered ROSAPLEX, a molecule that helps to promote a more even skin tone and has optimized the delivery of many key ingredients like hyaluronic acid to create products that offer unparalleled benefits for the skin. Shop the Neocutis collection today to find formulas to help you reveal new skin.
